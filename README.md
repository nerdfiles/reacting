# reacting

tryna get [arrested][arrested] with the sauce [not a decade too soon][fielding]; 
i.e., we will not be employing "state management," and we're concerned with 
drawing out what "statelessness" entails (e.g., "direct linking" or url-to-url 
processing).

## todo

obviously this doesn't even shake a stick at mike amundsen's [api-starter][starter], but 
the goal is to show how one can eventually achieve the [link relation types][lrt]
with a "popular" [framework][framework] (or "library"? *i don't care*), if "framework wars" must be endured for the next 
decade. of course, we were always supposed to think to abolish the "framework" as 
our apps mature such that they are built-to-last, but alas, nevertheless, we 
can still [preserve freedom][freedom] and the [accessibility of the accessible][a11y] 
and not introduce [performance][perf] [costs][slow] due to [weight][mf] and [cache][hard].

since the api☂︎ is 
[not][misc] [itself][hateoas] [rest-ful][siren] that we're hitting, we'll eventually show 
what it looks like for a client to suggest and encourage it civilly.
