on not storing anything at centralized stores like aws or pow blockchains: 
storage sematics shouldn't be claimed "securable" if not decentralized.

can pow blockchains or aws or azure claim securability? hardly.

nameability undermines their decentralization. securability only follows from 
usable and human-memorable names. *specializability* and *concretizability* are
made explicit in the given *concept system* (think like "concept album") as
indicators of the gradients of usability and memorability. no promise is given
that names will not be usable and/or human-memorable. "governance" systems
should be fairly warned about the traceability, adjustability, and incremental 
consistency, securability, processability, formability, deletability and
creatability, readability, lockability, estimability, routability, eventability,
etc. of an application programming interface. such quality properties of
web would be suggestive of programmability, interoperability, automatability,
intentionalizability, functional ultimacy, systemizability, multiple realizability,
translatability, (com)possibilizability, etc. unique to web as a sui generis substance.

e.g., suppose we wish to describe the "compossibilizability" of two [agents][agents], given
the internet of [things][].
