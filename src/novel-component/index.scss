/// ## panalogy
///
/// we consider a panalogy between [hypermedia-orientation][schema], in

/// formulation and atomic bem's `<...[class='a-b--e__m__'>`.

/// indeed, for `spog <> abem` with `emmet`,
/// 
/// ```
/// `/$$( element ){?s,p,o,g}` <> `<$$( element )[class="a-b--e__m__"]>`
/// ```
///
/// so, we can model all interactions in css to produce pure css carousels, 
/// etc., avoiding js traps like here [vitals] (see [trap] and [cachedjs])
///
/// by "[organic] bem" we consider "organs", "molecules", "atoms", which are 
/// combined with control flow terms like `if` and `for`. similarly, from 
/// a semantics-driven code design pattern modeling approach we can model
/// domain dependent roles of patterns for certain models, those "composite",
/// "flyweight", and "proxy" (or "subject").
///
/// 1. composite: "Leafs and their operations provide all domain dependent 
///    functionality. Everything else is just infrastructure allowing the 
///    hierarchical access to the leaf instances."
/// 2. flyweight: "Concrete Flyweight provides all domain dependent 
///    functionality. The rest is infrastructure for storing instances in 
///    memory providing access to them."
/// 3. proxy: "The domain dependent is the Real Sub ject (which often exists 
///    before Proxy pattern application) and functionality of Proxy 
///    participants that provide access to the Real Subject."
///
/// (1) is often used in interaction models presenting tree structure: tree 
/// maps, proof trees, binary trees, file directory trees, etc. (2) can be 
/// used for domain dependent functionality pertaining to state management:
/// interaction counters, form submission and error handling, etc. (3) concerns
/// behaviors like creative, formative, adjustive, processive subscription and 
/// hooking behaviors (see [resthooks] and [activitypub]). the idea is to think
/// less so in terms of "states" and rather in terms of "occasions." there's never 
/// really an `interactionCounter.count` set to `0`. it's "initial" value is
/// even in intuitive examples *given* to a context in which someone is perceptually
/// related to the output or the outcome of the program. `0` could very well depend
/// on whether or not the computer one is using hiccups or non-deterministically
/// pulls information from another peripheral. we don't have to suppose nefarious
/// hacking, only that `0` is not some answer we should fix our implementation
/// style to presuming. "0" is string to some, an integer to others: as web developers
/// we don't care when it comes to designing the interaction in affordance.
///
/// this posture of "data-agnosticism," if you will, allows web developers to
/// see "data as code": the "initial" value for an InteractionCounter could 
/// be anything, we could receive a script injection for all we know. the interface
/// will at times require to be sensitive to this possibility, a situation of occasion.
/// in most cases, inputs will have to be guarded by the interface from the server
/// and vice versa, from the client. in this way, the client can send attribute-level
/// information about itself for the server to determine its level of trustworthiness, 
/// and so too here, can the client. we can send `disabled="true"` along with HTTP POST
/// requests to "create" a "user" from some persons engaging with the API. in a sense,
/// our assumption is that the server is receptive to non-javascript clients. the server
/// tries to accomodate as many quality properties from the client, since the client
/// itself is a mixed domain of software, like web browsers, and the bespoke code 
/// corresponding to the server itself, the client. the client cannot be "trusted"
/// in proportion to those ranges of capabilities the server is not interested in
/// confirming nor understanding. a `disabled` state for a `<button>` may be interesting
/// but the operating system settings information about the CPU or peripherals may not
/// be (unless that's what the web service or product is *about*).

/// questions are implicated in daily planning and re-assessment of sprints or work 
/// works to be considered. it's also important to understand how adjustability,
/// consistency expectations of components, and traceability shape outcomes of 
/// maintainability and maintenance in a reliable way. tools for reporting css 
/// specificity can aid in revealing emergent complexity in stylesheet code relative 
/// to named components. the problem with "utility classing" components is that
/// the names assume a delivered ensemble of stylesheets at the document: any number
/// of class string values can appear anywhere in the document's tags: `grid:md` here,
/// `column-12` there, and `input-border-dashed` elsewhere. between these three 
/// names we've expressed the concept of a "grid", a "column", adaptiveness, 
/// layout, modality, and so much else. the "order" of these concepts or how they're 
/// intended to be used isn't explicit by the space-delimited grammar common 
/// to bootstrap, semanticui, tailwindcss, and the like: `Noun Noun Noun` is what
/// is being communicated at the level of specializability and concretizability. "activity"
/// as such has to be read from the styleesheet. at once, the posture of not wishing to
/// open a "css" file jointly with an "html" file, reading and jumping between the two files,
/// is not benefitted by employing the "utility classing" approach in 
/// authorship *if* one is unfamiliar with the codebase. "column-small" doesn'
/// t tell us what whatever is being made "small" is being made "small" 
/// relative to, and if the markup surrounding that "small" element, after parsing and 
/// processing, is not telling about what is to occur at the moment of reading, or readability.
/// a developer can read `column-small column-medium ...` but this tells us nothing 
/// about the context of application or presentation, how it was served, nor anything 
/// about how to trace it if it doesn't work out and we must adjust it. a developer 
/// may well take to `grep` and flagging down other bits of code if they seek
/// to understand how it fits in as a feature, but again now multiple files must be opened.
/// "utility" class frameworks are great for jotting out stylesheet code only to 
/// forget about it not worrying about "evolution" of the design. about the only person
/// who can become a specialist in such code, even immediately after authorship, is the person
/// who wrote it. like a car loses value immediately upon leaving the lot,
/// code by "utility" classes in documents like html barely enable developers to 
/// "pick up" where they left off in comprehending it, specializing in it, detecting
/// its concretizations, and so on. it's code that isn't "hard" like a rock, which
/// we would be able to look at, study['comma] change['comma] and improve in a reliable way. so, 
/// there are independent reasons for rejecting "utility" frameworks, and which
/// partially explain why they have yet to payout for increasing the accessibility
/// of the web. such frameworks reintroduce all patterns of using html tags 
/// for presentation, only they do so at the class attribute moment in authoring 
/// web documents. tags for presentation does not scale; doing the same thing 
/// with class attribute strings is equally unscalable.
///
/// html has various "presentational" tags; e.g., `<font>`. using a class 
/// `text-color-red` is no different from using html for this purpose. this 
/// is the key antipattern: misuse by purpose. it's not just that the class
/// being there doesn't achieve the end in question, applying some style to 
/// an element, but it's that *how* it's solved is out of sorts with 
/// scaling the interface as much as out of sort with the goal of html itself.
///
/// it goes without saying that also, if javascript is used at all, the developer
/// must code out treating `text-color-red` and whatever other "classes" may
/// appear *in javascript* whereas the splitting of similarity and difference
/// in decomposing the behavior in question can be done *in css* prior to 
/// solving the interaction problem in the first place.
