# novel component

so, "components" is a very popular term. i'd prefer to think from the middle 
toward the high and the low: there are norms (prescriptive) and parts 
(descriptive). "novel component" concerns the "evaluative," or "action-guiding" 
aspect of a component insofar as i wish to isolate how "component architecture"
relates to specializability and concretizability. when does a "part" like a
fancy `<input />` reveal the specialization necessary to change it? does a 
framework's implementation reduce or improve our capacity to solve the problem
using existing elements and hevaiors? some problems can be solved with a framework
but in many cases, "goto" solutions exist: the question is whether a framework
can enable and itself be improved by heterogeneous solutions development from
old and newer patterns developers discover as time goes.
